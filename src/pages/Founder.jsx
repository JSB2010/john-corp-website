            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Born in 1602 in a small village outside of London, John Cunningham showed an early aptitude for chemistry and natural sciences. His fascination with materials and their properties would eventually lead to the creation of one of the world's most enduring companies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In 1634, after years of experimentation, Cunningham developed a revolutionary adhesive formula derived from natural resins and animal proteins. This breakthrough formula, which would later evolve into what we now know as "Jizz Tech," was initially used for shipbuilding and construction during the early colonial period.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Cunningham's vision extended beyond mere commerce. He believed that strong bonds—both literal and metaphorical—were the foundation of progress. This philosophy continues to guide John Corp to this day, nearly four centuries after our founding.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-12 text-gray-800">Early Life and Education</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-700">Formative Years</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                John Cunningham was the third son of a respected apothecary, which gave him early access to various substances and compounds. From a young age, he assisted his father in the preparation of medicines and treatments, developing a keen understanding of chemical properties and reactions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                His formal education began at the local parish school, where he excelled in mathematics and natural philosophy. At the age of 16, he was apprenticed to a master craftsman who specialized in woodworking and construction, where he first encountered the limitations of existing binding agents.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                During this apprenticeship, Cunningham began his first experiments with adhesives, seeking to create stronger, more durable bonds for woodworking joints. These early experiments, while rudimentary, laid the groundwork for his later innovations.
              </p>

            <div className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-700">The Journey to Discovery</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In 1625, Cunningham embarked on a journey across Europe, studying with alchemists, craftsmen, and natural philosophers. His travels took him to France, Germany, and Italy, where he absorbed diverse knowledge about materials science as it existed in the 17th century.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Upon returning to England in 1630, he established a small workshop where he continued his experiments with various natural substances. It was here, after four years of trial and error, that he developed the first version of his revolutionary adhesive.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The breakthrough came when Cunningham discovered a unique method of processing tree resins combined with protein-rich animal products, creating a substance with remarkable bonding properties. This discovery would change the course of his life and establish a legacy that continues to this day.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-700">The First Workshop</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              In 1634, with financial backing from several prominent merchants who recognized the potential of his adhesive, Cunningham established the first John Corp workshop in London. The initial operation was modest, employing just five craftsmen who produced small batches of the adhesive for local shipbuilders and carpenters.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The superior quality of Cunningham's adhesive quickly gained recognition. By 1640, John Corp had secured contracts with the Royal Navy, providing adhesives for shipbuilding during a period of naval expansion. This royal patronage established the company's reputation and enabled rapid growth throughout the mid-17th century.

          <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8">
            <div className="md:w-1/2">
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                From the beginning, John Cunningham established core principles that would guide his company for centuries to come. He believed in continuous innovation, insisting that his formula could always be improved upon. This commitment to research and development remains a cornerstone of John Corp today.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Cunningham also emphasized quality and reliability above all else. He personally inspected batches of adhesive before they left the workshop and maintained strict quality control standards—revolutionary concepts for the 17th century.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="md:w-1/2">
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Perhaps most importantly, Cunningham fostered a culture of craftsmanship and pride in workmanship. He treated his employees with unusual respect for the time, providing fair wages and safe working conditions. He believed that the strength of his company, like his adhesive, depended on the strength of the bonds between the people who comprised it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                This human-centered approach to business was codified in the company charter of 1645, which stated that John Corp existed "to create bonds that endure, between materials and between men, for the betterment of all."

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                John Cunningham continued to lead his company until his death in 1672 at the age of 70. Throughout his life, he remained actively involved in research, constantly refining his adhesive formula and exploring new applications. By the time of his death, John Corp had expanded to three workshops in England and one in the American colonies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Cunningham's personal notebooks, preserved in the company archives, reveal a mind constantly at work. He documented hundreds of experiments, many failures, and the incremental improvements that led to increasingly effective adhesive formulations. His methodical approach to research and development was centuries ahead of its time.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                After Cunningham's death, leadership of the company passed to his son, Robert, who continued his father's commitment to innovation and quality. The Cunningham family remained involved in company leadership until the mid-19th century.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Today, nearly 400 years after its founding, John Corp continues to embody the principles established by John Cunningham. The modern Jizz Tech formula, while vastly more sophisticated than Cunningham's original creation, is the direct descendant of his work, refined through centuries of continuous improvement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Perhaps most importantly, John Cunningham's vision of creating bonds that last—both in materials and in human relationships—remains at the heart of our corporate mission. His portrait hangs in our headquarters, a reminder of the innovative spirit and commitment to excellence that has sustained John Corp for nearly four centuries.
